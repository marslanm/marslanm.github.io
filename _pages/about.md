Hi, I am Ph.D. candidate at [Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/). I am working with [Professor Preslav Nakov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DfXsKZ4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Shangsong Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4uggVcIAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research focus is on adapting foundational multi-modal models for vision tasks including image recognition, object detection and video action recognition. The goal is to steer these foundational models for downstream tasks with limited data (few-/zero-shot) while maintaining their pre-trained generalization for novel tasks.
