Hi, I am Ph.D. candidate at [Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/). I am working with [Professor Preslav Nakov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DfXsKZ4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Shangsong Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4uggVcIAAAAJ&hl=en). 

We are engaged in [Media Profiling](https://github.com/ramybaly/News-Media-Reliability) to assess bias and factuality at the outlet level. Our primary focus is understanding the correlations between mainstream media channels. We leverage social, contextual, and graphical data to predict credibility and political leanings. As this field is still emerging and relatively unexplored, our goal is to develop an efficient methodology capable of predicting media factuality and bias in real-time as soon as it's published, without relying heavily on extensive data crawling, but rather by analyzing its position within the media landscape.

Before joining MBZUAI, I conducted research in Conversational AI for low-resource languages at KICS, UET. In 2017, I was awarded the prestigious CSC scholarship for my Master's degree, which I successfully completed in 2020 with a focus on Artificial Intelligence. During my research, I worked under the supervision of Prof. Lu on projects related to sentiment analysis in low-resource languages and code-switching.
