I am working on [Media Profiling](https://github.com/ramybaly/News-Media-Reliability) to assess bias and factuality of News Media with [Professor Preslav Nakov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DfXsKZ4AAAAJ&hl=en). One of the objectives is to develop a methodology efficient for real-time analysis, minimizing reliance on extensive data crawling, and focusing on analyzing the media's position through media graphs. Also working on empathic similariy, emotional intelligence and cultural impact in LMs. Before joining MBZUAI, I worked on Conversational AI for low-resource languages at [Center for Language Engineering (CLE)](https://www.kics.edu.pk/labs/about/cle). In 2017, I was awarded the prestigious CSC scholarship for research based Master's degree, which I completed in 2020 with a focus on Artificial Intelligence. During my research, I worked with  [Professor Jianfeng Lu](https://teacher.njust.edu.cn/jsj/ljf/list.htm) on conducting sentiment analysis for low-resource language and code-switched data.
