I am Postdoctoral Researcher at IT:U Interdisciplinary Transformation University, Austria, working with [Prof. Yufang Hou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-fBym-EAAAAJ&hl=en) on misrepresentation of scientific claims in Media. During my PhD at MBZUAI, I explored [Media Profiling](https://github.com/ramybaly/News-Media-Reliability) to assess bias and factuality of News Media with [Professor Preslav Nakov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DfXsKZ4AAAAJ&hl=en). One of the objectives was to develop a efficient methodology for real-time analysis, minimizing reliance on extensive data crawling, and focusing on analyzing the media's position through media graphs. I am also interested in empathic comprehension, emotional intelligence and cultural impact in LMs. Before joining MBZUAI, I worked on Conversational AI for low-resource languages at [Center for Language Engineering (CLE)](https://www.kics.edu.pk/labs/about/cle). I completed my Masterâ€™s degree in Artificial Intelligence in 2020 at NJUST in Nanjing, China, under the supervision of [Professor Jianfeng Lu](https://teacher.njust.edu.cn/jsj/ljf/list.htm).
